Notes about MySQL 5.1 package:
==============================

With MySQL 5.1 package we introduced some changes you may like to know. Most of
them will affect you only if you are upgrading from previous version and you
did some changes to your configuration.

1) Plugins:
===========

One of the new features in MySQL 5.1 is support for plugins. So some of the
storage engines are now shipped like that. You can use following plugins:

 - archive
 - blackhole
 - federated
 - example

InnoDB is still compiled as internal part of MySQL. If you are upgrading from
version 5.0 or if this is your first installation of MySQL 5.1, all plugins
will be enabled by default and you can disable them manually later (see
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/uninstall-plugin.html).

With this change you need to remove skip-federated option from your my.cnf file
if you have changed it manually. This option was there by default in previous
versions of MySQL.

2) File locations:
==================

There were some changes in files locations. Most of them were made in the
default configuration file so if you are experiencing problems and you have
made some manual adjustments to your /etc/my.cnf, try to merge this file with
/etc/my.cnf.rpmnew.

File locations changes:
 - MySQL socket file and pid file were moved from /var/lib/mysql to more
   reasonable location ( /run/mysql ) by default.
 - MySQL log files are in /var/log/mysql.

3) BerkeleyDB:
==============

MySQL no longer contains BerkeleyDB as storage engine. There is no fix for that
and if you used it before, you have to migrate your data to different storage
engine BEFORE updating. This can be done for example using following command:

	ALTER TABLE foo ENGINE = INNODB;

4) MySQL Upgrade Log
====================

If you missed messages displayed during automatic MySQL database upgrade, you
can find them from now on in

	/var/log/mysql/mysqld-upgrade.log
